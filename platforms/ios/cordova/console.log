Featuring humorous and often grotesque parodies of common household brands like ?Windaxe� cleaner and ?Smoochers� jam, Wacky Packages: New New New offers a tongue-in-cheek critique of consumer culture and marketing subversion. Created by a host of comics artists including Kim Deitch, Bill Griffith, Jay Lynch, and Norm Saunders, alongside Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman, Wacky Packages; New New New is a colorful, edgy, and intensely creative collection of illustrations.

This new collection presents all the Wacky Packs from Series 8?14 covering the years 1974 and 1975. Featuring humorous and often grotesque parodies of common household brands like ?Windaxe� cleaner and ?Smoochers� jam, Wacky Packages: New New New offers a tongue-in-cheek critique of consumer culture and marketing subversion. Created by a host of comics artists including Kim Deitch, Bill Griffith, Jay Lynch, and Norm Saunders, alongside Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman, Wacky Packages; New New New is a colorful, edgy, and intensely creative collection of illustrations. Packaged with four never-before-seen stickers and a wax jacket, Wacky Packages: New New New will please fans and collectors alike.","notes":"","isbn10":"0810988380","lcc_number":"","author_data":[{"name":"The Tre Tryckare Company","id":"the_tre_tryckare_company"},{"id":"lynch_jay","name":"Lynch, Jay"}],"awards_text":"","publisher_text":"Abrams ComicArts","title_long":"","language":""}]
